# What is Depression?

Depression is a serious chronic mental health condition experienced by people around the world. It is estimated that about 13% of Canadians will experience clinical depression in their lifetime, with females being twice as likely as males to be diagnosed with this condition. Researchers have found that one episode of depression is a strong predictor of future episodes. Furthermore, approximately 50% of remitted and recovered individuals still experience a relapse or recurrence within a 12-month period.

The presentation and experience of depression is unique to every individual, but the following are some common symptoms:

- Low mood
- Loss of interest or pleasure in activities previously enjoyed
- Change in weight or appetite
- A slowing down of thought and physical movement (as observed by others)
- Decreased energy or fatigue
- Feelings of worthlessness, guilt, or hopelessness
- Poor concentration or decision-making
- Thoughts of death or suicide
