      The main objective of the SCOPE Trial is to examine whether a 7-week
      self-compassion program administered online can stave off the progression
      of depression and prevent the experience of this illness. The SCOPE Trial
      is composed of four parts that span over a 12-month period, including the
      7-week program. You will be compensated for your participation in this
      meaningful research.
