# What Is Self-Compassion?

Self-compassion is defined as being moved by one’s own suffering, and having a desire to alleviate such suffering. Rather than criticizing and judging oneself for any perceived failures or inadequacies, self-compassion is reflected through a sense of kindness and understanding towards oneself, and to accept one’s “humanness”. Researchers have found that self-compassion is associated with greater well-being and other positive health outcomes. Learn more about [self-compassion.](/)
