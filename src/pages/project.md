# The SCOPE Trial

Self-compassion is a flourishing concept in Western psychology. Evidence from scientific research shows that self-compassion is associated with positive outcomes, such as reduced depression symptoms, enhanced well-being, and increased resiliency to stress. Self-compassion interventions have shown to be effective in treating acute depression; however, researchers have not yet tested whether these interventions can prevent future episodes of depression. The main objective of the SCOPE Trial is to examine whether a self-directed self-compassion reflection program administered online can stave off the progression of depression and prevent the experience of this illness.

# Your Involvement

Your involvement in the study will include the following tasks:

## Questionnaires

You will be asked to complete a demographics form and several short questionnaires throughout the study (at the 3-month, 6-month, 9-month, and 12-month check-ins). The questionnaires will ask about how you feel, think, and act in certain situations, as well as your day-to-day experiences.

## Phone Interviews

ou will be asked to partake in several phone interviews where a researcher will ask you ca series of question about your mood and history of daily functioning. The first phone interview will determine your eligibility to further participate in the study. Once eligibility is established, there will be four additional phone interviews at the 3-month, 6-month, 9-month, and 12-month check-ins where you will be asked similar questions.

## Self-Compassion Program

Once eligibility is established, you will be asked to complete an online audio self-directed program on self-compassion. The program lasts approximately 6 hours and 40 minutes and will be divided into six audio sessions. You will receive 1 audio session per week to complete over 6 weeks. The content of the program includes education and research on self-compassion, and exercises designed to cultivate self-compassion.

# Compensation

You will be compensated for your participation in the study: a $10 gift card for completing the first part and a $10 gift card completing the second part of the study, and then, if eligible, you will receive a $30 gift card for each of the first three check-ins (for a total of $90 in gift cards) and a $40 gift card for the fourth (and final) check-in. You are eligible to receive a total of $150 in gift cards.‚Äù
